# Natural History Museum | Feed the Dino
This project is a digital solution to a problem that the Natural History Museum have identified: “How to make particular objects accessible to a range of audiences.”

This solution is for the Dinosaur section in the museum.

## The Solution should:
* Turn visitor into “advocates for the planet”.
* Igniting curiosity about the natural world
* Encouraging people to tackle the challenges facing the health of the planet
* Empowering people to make informed choices for the future.
